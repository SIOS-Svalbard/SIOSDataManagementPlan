== Data summary

SIOS is a regional observing system for long-term measurements in and
around Svalbard addressing Earth System Science questions. SIOS
integrates the existing distributed observational infrastructure and
generates added value for all partners beyond what their individual
capacities can provide.

SIOS brings observations together into a coherent and integrated
observational programme that will be sustained over a long period.
Within SIOS, researchers can cooperate to access instruments, acquire
data and address questions that would not be practical or cost effective
for a single institution or nation alone.

By bringing many types of observations together and asking questions
about how these are influenced by each other SIOS generates new insights
about the Svalbard region’s role in the Earth system. Thus, SIOS offers
unique opportunities for research and the long-term acquisition of
fundamental knowledge about global environmental change.

SIOS focuses on processes and their interactions between the different
spheres, i.e. biosphere, geosphere, atmosphere, cryosphere and
hydrosphere. The core observational programme of SIOS provides the
research community with systematic observations that are sustained over
time, yet dynamic enough to be adapted as new methods and questions from
society appear.

SIOS sets an example for how to systematically construct observational
networks in the Arctic and how joint efforts provide added value to the
user community. The services benefit the international polar research
community as a whole and make SIOS a unique international meeting place
for developing the science of long-term monitoring in Polar Regions.

SIOS is based on existing data collection, gap analyses and mitigation
of gaps identified from a scientific perspective. This implies that
legacy data comes in a wide range of data formats and types. Part of the
work is to harmonise the data collection, but this has to be done in a
stepwise manner. Initially, the main focus is on harmonising new data
and some core datasets.

The existing datasets collected by the partners at the infrastructure
locations described by the Research Infrastructure overview and by the
instruments identified is already handled by existing data management
systems operated by the partners. The SIOS Data Management System
connects these individual systems to a unified virtual data management
system.

The main part of the data comes from permanent instrumentation located
at SIOS Infrastructure locations in Ny-Ålesund (several research
stations), Longyearbyen, Hornsund as well as a number of locations
scattered around the Svalbard islands (e.g. meteorological stations) and
in the surrounding ocean (e.g. Fram and Hausgarten observatories and
regular sections or profiles).

The total amount of data is yet not known as the Scientific Optimisation
Advisory Group is identifying the core datasets.

The data is vital to the understanding of Earth System processes in and
around Svalbard.

=== Making data findable, including provisions for metadata [fair data]

The SIOS Data Management System relies on documentation of datasets
through Discovery metadata (technical guidelines under development).
These metadata are maintained by the data centres contributing to SIOS.
The central node of SIOS is harvesting these metadata on a regular basis
and ingests them in a central catalogue which is used to support users
through the SIOS Web Portal.

SIOS promotes the implementation of Persistent Identifiers at each
contributing data centre. Some have this in place, while others are in
the process of establishing this. SIOS is not creating this centrally.

The diversity of data handled by SIOS implies that a full overview is
not possible in the current situation. However, SIOS is promoting
utilisation of standards. One example is encoding of geophysical data
using NetCDF following the Climate and Forecast convention. There are
however issues with many of the standards and these issues have to be
addressed by the SIOS Data Management System Working Group as the system
evolves.

The search model used is based on GCMD Science Keywords for parameter
mapping. Not all data centres use these. Where possible, the central
node will map between local vocabularies used by the data centres and
the GCMD keywords until a more uniform annotation of data is possible.
That will however take time as large legacy systems are integrated in
SIOS.

Versioning of data is the responsibility of the contributing data
centres and SIOS formulates requirements in the technical guidelines.
Some data centres have this in place, while others are working on this.
Full implementation, will as other issues take time and depend on the
resources available.

The central node can consume GCMD DIF and ISO19115 records (using GCMD
keywords). Support for more formats is considered, but depends on
resources.

=== Making data openly accessible [fair data]

All metadata will be available through a search interface integrated in
the SIOS web portal. Some data may have access restrictions (as the data
policy also opens for). These will be handled accordingly by the
responsible data centre. In the long perspective Single Sign On is
planned, but this is not feasible within the resources available
initially.

Data are made available by the responsible data centre. No data is
handled centrally in the first version, only services towards data.
Initially a wide range of access solutions and formats will be used. The
SIOS Data Management Working Group is however developing technical
guidelines addressing this issue as well. Implementation will have to be
stepwise and at different speeds for the different data centres.

Methods and software for accessing data is under development. However,
the intention is to use internationally accepted open standards (as
mentioned above) which have a wide range of open software tools
available. The central system for dataset discovery is developed under a
GNU General Public License version 2 or higher. Some parts are published
under GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or higher.

Metadata and data for the datasets are maintained by the responsible
data centres, metadata supporting unified search is harvested and
ingested in the central node. A dedicated GitHuB area has been set up
for sharing software, but much of the software is already open source
and in well maintained repositories. The addresses of these repositories
will be collected and published within the infrastructure Intranet
(including the GitHub repository).

Datasets with restrictions are initially handled by the responsible data
centre. Generally the metadata will be searchable and contain
information on how to request access to the dataset.

=== Making data interoperable [fair data]

The current situation for the legacy datasets of SIOS is that there is
no common level of interoperability at the data level. Some data centres
support or have started to implement OPeNDAP and use metadata following
the Climate and Forecast conventions.

At the metadata level, interoperability is better as many of the data
centres do support GCMD DIF with the appropriate controlled
vocabularies.

The interoperability aspect of SIOS will evolve and will require
substantial support through dedicated resources.

A system for semantic translation of annotated discovery metadata
content is under development, but many of the controlled vocabularies
are not available in machine readable form, neither have they been
compared with other vocabularies (whether within or external to the
discipline in question). This is work in progress. Relevant efforts of
Research Data Alliance, ENVRIPlus and WMO are followed.

Initially GCMD Science keywords will be used, but given the open data
space of SIOS, this has to be evaluated continuously. Currently mapping
between GCMD and CF keywords is supported (but needs to be updated),
mapping from e.g. the Canadian Polar Data Catalogue keywords are also
supported.

=== Increase data re-use (through clarifying licenses) [fair data]

The data policy promotes free and open data sharing. However, while the
data policy outlines the general rules of sharing data, a license
describes the specific requirements for a dataset. Within SIOS each
dataset will have a license. The SIOS recommendation is to use
https://creativecommons.org/licenses/[Creative Commons] attribution for
data.

According to the current version of the Data Policy:
____
SIOS data delivered in a timely manner means delivery of data without
un-due delay. Any delay, due or un-due, shall not be longer than one
year. Discovery metadata shall be delivered immediately.
____

Referring to the SIOS Data Policy, SIOS is promoting free and open
access to data. Some data may have constraints and may be available to
members only initially. If SIOS is to be terminated, data are still
maintained by the contributing data centres and availability of data
depends on the resources and priorities of those data centres.

Initially SIOS relies on data quality assurance processes implemented at
each contributing data centre and by the Principal Investigators
involved. Concerning the scientific quality of SIOS output, this depends
on the data used and is monitored by the Science Optimisation and
Advisory Group. The Science Optimisation Advisory Group will recommend
actions or evaluations to be performed by the Data management working
group.

As long as SIOS operates the intention is to make observations available
at any time, for simulations or analysed products, the norm will be 10
years, but subject to the decision of the Science Optimisation Advisory
Group.

IMPORTANT: SIOS promotes the usage of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license on all data.

== Allocation of resources

In the current situation as the SIOS infrastructure is being developed,
there is no overview of the total costs for making SIOS data FAIR. SIOS
relies on existing infrastructures which in most cases already have FAIR
elements implemented at the metadata level. At the dataset level very
few data centres comply with FAIR principles. 

Activities within the SIOS Data Management System (SDMS) are coordinated through the SDMS Working Group which every year plans for the work to be undertaken and the resources needed in a work plan that is submitted to the SIOS Board of Directors and finally approved by the General Assembly.

Below, the data centres involved in SDMS, and their respective members of the
SIOS Data Management System Working Group are listed.

|=======================================================================

In the current situation SIOS has no overview of the costs of long term
preservation of data. As mentioned, SIOS is built upon existing data
streams and data centres. Thus these data are not only used for SIOS and
would be preserved anyway.

Concerning the value of data preservation, observations are priceless
for understanding our environment.

Development of the SDMS and handling of data within this is managed by the SDMS Working Group (WG) which reports to the SIOS Board of Directors and eventually the General Assembly. The SDMS WG has about 20 membersfootnote:[The number of members fluctuates.]

== Data security

Data security relies on the existing mechanisms of the contributing data
centres. Currently SIOS has no recommendations in this context, but such
recommendations are likely to be made later.

The central node relies on secure HTTP traffic, but not all contributing
data centres support this yet. This is expected to evolve during
implementation.

== Ethical aspects

Ethical aspects are handled in the SIOS Data Policy.

== Other

Currently not applicable.
